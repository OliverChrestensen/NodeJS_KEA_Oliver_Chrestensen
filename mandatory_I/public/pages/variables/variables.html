        <p class="card-text">Variables are containers for storing data. There is 4 ways to declare a variable. 1. to use var. 2. to use let 3. to use const.
             4. to not use anythting before the variable name. The most commen used is const or let. 
              </p> <br>
  
              <h6>Const</h6>
              <p>A variable using the keyword const cant be reassigned or redelcared therefor a const variable must be assigned a value when delcared.
                  A general rule is, always declare a variable with const unless you know that the value will change. The keyword const is a little misleading.
                  It does not define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value.</p>
  
                  <h6>Let</h6>
                  <p>Variables declared by let have their scope in the block for which they are declared, as well as in any contained sub-blocks. In this way, let works very much like var. The main difference is that the scope of a var variable is the entire enclosing function:
                      The var keyword allows you to redeclare a variable without any issue. let Variables are not attached to the global object. Redeclaring a variable using the let keyword will cause an error.
